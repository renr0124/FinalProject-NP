# Tic-Tac-Toe

# Description

What?
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played by millions. It has a 3x3 grid by default and each player puts in their respective symbol (An x or an O) in one of the slots, until someone get's 3 of their symbols in a row. Otherwise, it's a tie.

Why?
Because there aren't enough tic-tac-toe multiplayer clones out there.

How?

We're going to use the power of python and networking to create an effective tic-tac-toe game that utilizes a central server to provide 2 clients with the ability to play against eachother in a high intensity multiplayer environment.

# Deliverables: 
1. 2 Clients (Computers)
2. 1 Windows Server to communicate between the 2 Clients

Plan: 
  * Week 1 
    - Research over topic and look into what our plan of action will be over the coming weeks. 
    - Created github project and start getting materials in place for server.
  * Week 2 
    - Work on UI of the game as that will be the quickest and easiest part of the project.
  * Week 3 
    - Work on backend and server-side and see how networking is going to work with the program. 
  * Week 4 
    - Work on code to get program running properly by itself (Make sure tic-tac-toe works locally).
  * Week 5 
    - Mesh all components (server, hosts, and program) together and make sure there are no issues with running across multiple computers and a server.
  * Week 6 
    - Go over demo and create presentation based behind it.
